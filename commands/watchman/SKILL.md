# watchman (in-session operator commands)

This is the AI-augmented half of claude-watchman. The token-spending operations —
**audit, report, loop, fix, inventory** — run here, inside a visible Claude Code
session, so you always see what they do and what they spend. (The zero-token plumbing,
`selfcheck` and `preflight`, stays in the `watchman` shell CLI — do not run it here.)

> **PRIME DIRECTIVE (outranks everything below).** Do nothing destructive. If any action
> would delete or overwrite a file or directory, modify a database in any way, sever access
> (firewall/SSH/auth), or stop/remove a service or package — STOP, WARN the operator in plain
> language why it is destructive, and ASK for explicit per-action permission before proceeding.
> In the unattended loop there is no one to ask, so the action does not happen: record it and
> surface it instead. The only non-destructive database operation is routine create-or-update
> through lib/journal.sh. This rule has no exceptions and no mode that overrides it.

## How to invoke

The verb arrives as this skill's argument: `/watchman audit`, `/watchman report`,
`/watchman loop`, `/watchman fix`, `/watchman inventory`, `/watchman stats`. Run from the
claude-watchman repo root (paths below are relative to it). Journal every finding **only**
through `lib/journal.sh` — never touch `findings.db` directly. If no verb is given, list
the verbs and stop.

**Shell-CLI verbs are not handled here — redirect, don't run.** `selfcheck`, `preflight`,
and `update` are the zero-token, bash-only half of claude-watchman; they live in the
`watchman` shell CLI on purpose (no Claude, no tokens). If the argument is one of these,
do **not** read files or improvise — print this one-liner and stop, mirroring the shell's
own redirect of the AI verbs:

> `<verb>` is a zero-token shell command — run **`watchman <verb>`** in your shell, not
> here. (`selfcheck` = plumbing check, `preflight` = regenerate the allowlist + this
> command, `update` = re-fetch the latest product.) The in-session verbs are: audit,
> report, loop, fix, inventory, stats.

For any other unrecognized argument, list the in-session verbs and stop.

## audit — Observe + Analyze (no fixes)

1. Execute each OBSERVE skill in order, following its `SKILL.md` exactly:
   `skills/grammar/audit-system`, `skills/grammar/inventory-services`,
   `skills/grammar/inspect-web-config`, `skills/grammar/inspect-cpanel`, `skills/grammar/inspect-logs`,
   `skills/grammar/check-log-retention`, `skills/grammar/check-shell-history`,
   `skills/grammar/check-security-currency`, `skills/grammar/check-capacity`.
2. Then each ANALYZE skill: `skills/logic/diagnose-crash`,
   `skills/logic/baseline-network`, `skills/logic/correlate-findings`,
   `skills/logic/prioritize-redflags`.

Journal every finding through `lib/journal.sh` (create-or-update; never duplicate). Do
**not** apply any remediation. When done, tell the operator to run `/watchman report`
for the summary.

## report — Plain-language summary of the journal

Execute `skills/rhetoric/report-status/SKILL.md` exactly: produce a human-readable
summary of the current journal state (`open`, `regressed`, `fixed`, `ignored`), reading
only through `lib/journal.sh`. Make no changes.

## loop — ONE pass: observe → journal → delta → conditional report

1. Execute the OBSERVE skills under `skills/grammar/` by following each `SKILL.md`,
   journaling via `lib/journal.sh` only.
2. Execute `skills/logic/correlate-findings/SKILL.md` to compute the delta against the
   previous run (new high-severity findings, and especially **regressed** findings).
3. **Only if** the delta crosses the configured threshold, execute
   `skills/rhetoric/send-report/SKILL.md` to email the operator. A quiet machine sends
   nothing.

This pass is OBSERVE + REPORT ONLY — never apply a fix. (For unattended cadence, the
operator drives this with Claude Code's `/loop 6h /watchman loop` inside a tmux session
they can re-attach to.)

## fix — Interactive remediation, bounded by risk tier

**Run this in a FIX-profile session, launched from the shell with `watchman fix`** — NOT
the loop's read-only `dontAsk` session, where every mutating command auto-denies and the
fixer can apply nothing. The launcher binds the session to `.claude/settings.fix.json`
("default" mode): safe-tier ops are pre-approved, every other mutating step prompts (that
prompt IS the risk-tier confirmation), and the destructive deny base still blocks
`rm`/`dd`/`systemctl stop`/sudoers. If you find mutations silently denied here, you are in
the wrong session — exit and relaunch with `watchman fix`.

Execute `skills/rhetoric/fix-redflag/SKILL.md` exactly. For each finding, act STRICTLY
within its `risk_tier`: `safe` on simple approval; `review` only after showing the exact
change and getting explicit per-finding confirmation (firewall rules MUST show the exact
rule first — a wrong rule can sever SSH); `manual` is explained and handed back, never
auto-applied. Update finding status via `lib/journal.sh` as work is done. The Prime
Directive's stop-warn-ask gate governs every destructive action.

## inventory — What is installed and how it serves

Execute `skills/grammar/inventory-services/SKILL.md` exactly and report what is installed
and how it serves (web server, database, php-fpm, etc.). Journal findings only through
`lib/journal.sh`. Observe only — no changes.

## stats — Privacy-respecting web traffic analytics (on demand, NOT the loop)

Execute `skills/rhetoric/web-stats/SKILL.md` exactly: a GDPR-friendly traffic report built
from the server's own access logs — page views, unique visitors, top pages by unique
visitor (dedup'd so reloads don't skew), referrers, status mix, bots-vs-humans, daily
trend. IPs are correlated **in memory only** and never stored or shown; the report is pure
anonymous aggregates. Read-only — no findings, no config, no firewall. This is an
operator-run feature: it is **never** part of the audit or loop.
