# check-log-retention (Grammar / Observe)

Establishes whether the forensic trail will even survive. On a workstation this is
the **highest-value check**: journald often defaults to volatile storage, so logs
vanish on reboot — and `diagnose-crash` depends on logs persisting across the very
reboot that followed the failure. Read-only.

> **PRIME DIRECTIVE (outranks everything below).** Do nothing destructive. If any action
> would delete or overwrite a file or directory, modify a database in any way, sever access
> (firewall/SSH/auth), or stop/remove a service or package — STOP, WARN the operator in plain
> language why it is destructive, and ASK for explicit per-action permission before proceeding.
> In the unattended loop there is no one to ask, so the action does not happen: record it and
> surface it instead. The only non-destructive database operation is routine create-or-update
> through lib/journal.sh. This rule has no exceptions and no mode that overrides it.

## When to use

Every `watchman audit` / `watchman loop`. On a fresh Arch install several of these
often need fixing — surface them clearly.

## Workflow

1. **Preflight.** `source lib/journal.sh lib/distro.sh lib/profile.sh`; `journal_init`.
2. **journald persistence.** Read `Storage=` in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` (and
   drop-ins). Volatile or unset + no `/var/log/journal/` directory ⇒ logs do NOT
   survive reboot. Journal `check_id=log_retention_volatile`, severity from
   `profile_severity` (higher on workstation), `risk_tier=safe`,
   remediation: set `Storage=persistent` and `mkdir /var/log/journal`.
3. **journald size limits.** Read `SystemMaxUse=`; unbounded growth is
   `check_id=journal_size_unbounded`, `risk_tier=safe`.
4. **logrotate.** Is logrotate installed and is `/etc/logrotate.conf` +
   `/etc/logrotate.d/` present and non-empty? Missing rotation for active log files
   ⇒ `check_id=log_rotation_missing`, `risk_tier=safe`.
5. **Journal each** with a clear plain-language `detail` of what is lost if
   unaddressed. Never edit these configs here — that is `fix-redflag` (all `safe`-tier).

## Grounding

- `lib/distro.sh` — `pkg_is_installed` (logrotate), `service_status`.
- `lib/profile.sh` — `profile_severity` (retention weighs heavier on workstation).
- `lib/journal.sh` — `journal_upsert`.
